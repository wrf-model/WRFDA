In this directory there are hdf utility programs, makefiles, and a 
subdirectory, testfiles/, which contains all the data files needed to test
the utilities. 

The utilities are:

    . hdf24to8 -- converts 24-bit raster images to hdf 8-bit images

    . hdfcomp -- re-compresses an 8-bit raster hdf file
   
    . hdfls -- lists basic information about an hdf file

    . hdfpack --  compacts an hdf file

    . hdftopal -- extracts a palette from an hdf file
  
    . hdftor8 -- extracts 8-bit raster images and palettes from an
                 hdf file

    . hdfed -- hdf file editor

    . hdfunpac - unpacks an HDF file by exporting the scientific
                 data elements (DFTAG_SD) to external object
                 elements.  This is a utility for external file
                 handling for the parallel I/O interface on the CM5.

    . paltohdf -- converts a raw palette to hdf

    . r8tohdf -- converts 8-bit raster images to hdf

    . ristosds -- converts a series of raster image hdf files into a
                  single 3D sds hdf file. 

    . vmake -- creates vsets 

    . vshow -- dumps out vsets in an hdf file

    . jpeg2hdf -- converts jpeg images to hdf raster images

    . hdf2jpeg -- converts hdf raster images to jpeg images

    . fp2hdf -- converts 2D and 3D floating point data sets into HDF SDS.
