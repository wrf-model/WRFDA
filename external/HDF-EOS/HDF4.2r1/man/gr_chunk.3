.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "GRsetchunk"
This routine makes the GR a chunked GR according to the chunk
definition passed in.

The dataset currently cannot be special already i.e. NBIT,
COMPRESSED, or EXTERNAL. This is an Error.

The defintion of the "HDF_CHUNK_DEF" union with relvant fields is:
.nf

typedef union hdf_chunk_def_u
{
int32  chunk_lengths[2];  Chunk lengths along each dimension.
       {
         int32     chunk_lengths[2]; Chunk lengths along each dimension.
         int32     comp_type;        Compression type
         comp_info cinfo;            Compression info struct
       }comp;
} HDF_CHUNK_DEF
.fi

The variable agruement 'flags' is a bit-or'd value which can currently be 'HDF_CHUNK' or 'HDF_CHUNK | HDF_COMP'.

The simplist is the 'chunk_lengths' array specifiying chunk 
lengths for each dimension where the 'flags' argument set to 
'HDF_CHUNK';

COMPRESSION is set by using the 'HDF_CHUNK_DEF' union to set the
appropriate compression information along with the required chunk lengths
for each dimension. The compression information is the same as 
that set in 'GRsetcompress()'. The bit-or'd 'flags' argument' is set to 
'HDF_CHUNK | HDF_COMP'.

See the example in pseudo-C below for further usage.

The maximum number of Chunks in an HDF file is 65,535.

The performance of the GRxxx interface with chunking is greatly
affected by the users access pattern over the image and by
the maximum number of chunks set in the chunk cache. The cache contains 
the Least Recently Used(LRU cache replacment policy) chunks. See the
routine GRsetchunkcache() for further info on the chunk cache and how 
to set the maximum number of chunks in the chunk cache. A default chunk 
cache is always created.

The following example shows the organization of chunks for a 2D array.

e.g. 4x4 array with 2x2 chunks. The array shows the layout of
chunks in the chunk array.

.SS "GRgetchunkinfo"
This routine gets any special information on the GR. If its chunked,
chunked and compressed or just a regular GR. Currently it will only
fill the array of chunk lengths for each dimension as specified in
the "HDF_CHUNK_DEF" union. It does not tell you the type of compression
or the compression parameters used. You can pass in a NULL for "chunk_def"
if don't want the chunk lengths for each dimension.
Additionaly if successfull it will return a bit-or'd value in "flags"
indicating if the GR is:
.nf

       Chunked                  -> flags = HDF_CHUNK
       Chunked and compressed   -> flags = HDF_CHUNK | HDF_COMP
       Non-chunked              -> flags = HDF_NONE

e.g. 4x4 array - Pseudo-C
{
 int32   rcdims[3];
 HDF_CHUNK_DEF rchunk_def;
 int32   cflags;
 ...
 rchunk_def.chunk_lengths = rcdims;
 GRgetchunkinfo(sdsid, &rchunk_def, &cflags);
 ...
}.
.fi

.SS "GRsetchunkcache"
Set the maximum number of chunks to cache.

The cache contains the Least Recently Used(LRU cache replacment policy)
chunks. This routine allows the setting of maximum number of chunks that
can be cached, "maxcache".

The performance of the GRxxx interface with chunking is greatly
affected by the users access pattern over the dataset and by
the maximum number of chunks set in the chunk cache. The number chunks
that can be set in the cache is process memory limited. It is a good
idea to always set the maximum number of chunks in the cache as the
default heuristic does not take into account the memory available for
the application.

By default when the GR is created as a chunked element the
maximum number of chunks in the cache "maxcache" is set to the number of
chunks along the last dimension.

The values set here affects the current object's caching behaviour.

If the chunk cache is full and "maxcache" is greater then the
current "maxcache" value, then the chunk cache is reset to the 
new "maxcache" value, else the chunk cache remains at the 
current "maxcache" value.

If the chunk cache is not full, then the chunk cache is set to the
new "maxcache" value only if the new "maxcache" value is greater than the
current number of chunks in the cache.

Use flags argument of "HDF_CACHEALL" if the whole object is to be cached
in memory, otherwise pass in zero(0). Currently you can only
pass in zero.

See GRsetchunk() for a description of the organization of chunks in a GR .
